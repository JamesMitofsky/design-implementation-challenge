## Technical Details

### Using Material UI

The [AppBar component](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/app-bar/) can receive any of the props available to a [Paper component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-paper/#elevation), affording access to the Material Design spec's elevation and shadow system. To remove the shadow, set the elevation property to 0.
